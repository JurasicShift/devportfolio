const text = "Hello and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Michael Whyte and I am a self-taught M.E.R.N. stack developer based in Lancaster, England. I work as a library assistant and I'm currently seeking employment opportunities in web development. \n Driven by a love of learning, my interest in web development is a natural concomitant and extension of my work with the Library Service. Coming from an Arts and Humanities background (MA Critical Theory, BA(Hons) Film and Media Studies), and having little previous knowledge of STEM subjects, for me, web development emerged straight out of leftfield. Here is the story of how this came to fruition. \n Part of the mission statement of public libraries is to promote digital inclusion. Since 2018 I have delivered digital support to students on the Learn My Way course. To deliver the best possible educative experience and enhance my own digital skills, in 2019 I completed the Essential Digital Skills Level Two with the Distance Learning Centre. The seeds were sown for a growing interest in the active use of computers. \n A turning point came in early 2020 when I was asked to run a code club for kids. Having no experience with code I was hesitant but figured, if kids can code then I can too. With this in mind I borrowed a kids book on HTML and CSS and began experimenting. Struck by the power of HTML and CSS to produce online content, their syntactical composition and structural interrelation and the exchange between technology and creativity, I was hooked. The kids book became an adult book which became a web development bootcamp on Udemy. Since September 2022 I have delivered a weekly Coder Dojo for kids aged 7 â€“ 11. \n Beyond web development my interests are split between outdoor activities and more academic pursuits. I have completed 5 marathons and 6 half marathons up and down the UK. I enjoy travel and have gained my advanced open water diving certificate in Indonesia. I recently walked the Cumbria Way and I'm currently training to swim the length of Coniston Water (5.25 miles). I enjoy learning French and reading French literature. My other reading interests include history, politics, philosophy, critical theory, psychoanalysis, science fiction and classics. \n";
