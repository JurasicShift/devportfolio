const text = "Michael Whyte is a self taught M.E.R.N. stack devleoper based in Lancaster, England. Michael works as a library assistant and is currently seeking employment opportunities in web development. \n Driven by a love of learning, his interest in web development is a natural concomitant and extension of his work with the Library Service. With an Arts and Humanities background (MA Critial Theory, BA(Hons) Film & Media Studies), and having little previous knowledge of STEM subjects, web development emerged straight out of leftfield. Here is the story of how this came to fruition. \n Part of the mission statement of public libraries is to promote digital inclusion. Since 2018 Michael has delivered digital support to students on the Learn My Way course. To deliver the best possible educative experience and enhance his own digital skills, in 2019 Michael completed the Essential Digital Skills Level Two with the Distance Learning Centre. \n A turning point came in early 2020 when Michael was asked to run a code club for kids. Having no experience with code he was hesitant but figured, if kids can code then I can too. With this in mind he borrowed a kids book on HTML and CSS and began experimenting. Struck by the power of HTML and CSS to produce online content, their syntactical composition and structural interrelation, and the exchange between technology and creativity, he was hooked. The kids book became an adult book which became a web development bootcamp on Udemy. Since September 2022 Michael has delivered a weekly Coder Dojo for kids aged 7 â€“ 11. \n Beyond web development his interests are split between  outdoor activities and more academic pursuits. Michael has completed 5 marathons and 6 half marathons up and down the UK. He enjoys travel and gained his advanced open water diving certificate in Indonesia. He recently walked the Cumbria Way and is currently training to swim the length of Coniston Water (5.25 miles). Michael enjoys learning French and reading French literature. His other reading interests include: history, politics, philosophy, critical theory, psychoanalysis, science fiction and classics. \n";
