				Driven by a love of learning, his interest in web development is a
				natural concomitant and extension of his work with the Library Service.
				With an Arts and Humanities background (MA Critial Theory, BA(Hons) Film
				& Media Studies), and having little previous knowledge of STEM subjects, web
				development emerged straight out of leftfield. Here is the story of how this came to fruition.

				A turning point came in early 2020 when Michael was asked to run a code
				club for kids. Having no experience with code he was hesitant but
				figured, if kids can code then I can too. With this in mind he borrowed
				a kids book on HTML and CSS and began experimenting. Struck by
				the power of HTML and CSS to produce online content, their syntactical composition and
				structural interrelation and the exchange
				between technology and creativity, he was hooked. The kids book became an adult
				book which became a web development bootcamp on{' '}

				Beyond web development his interests are split between outdoor

				and 6 half marathons up and down the UK. He enjoys travel and gained his advanced open water diving certificate in Indonesia. He
